<p align="center">Adopta.Agency is a movement to encourage average citizens to adopt government agencies, and the open data that they produce. Many government agencies have been hard at work opening up their data, but they just don't have the resources to do everything, and they need our help.</p>
<p>Adopta.Agency is not a technology, is an open blueprint, that allows you to target a topic, area of government, or specific datasets, and move it forward one step by producing JSON, and two steps forward by launching an open API that can be used in websites, mobile applications, visualizations, and any other reason.</p>
<p>When data is cleaned up, truly machine readable, and available as JSON via a single file, or more advanced engagement using an API, will dramatically increase the chances open data will get put to use, potentially making a positive impact on how our society works.
<p>If you are passionate about being the change you want to see in federal, please join the movement:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Identify Data - Come up with ideas for Adopta projects, targeting specific data and topics for improvement.</li>
  <li>Improve Data - Acquire, clean up, organize, convert, and publish the data as simple CSV and JSON files.</li>
  <li>Share Data - Publish the data to Github as publicly available JSON and CSV files, and if you have the resources, you launch an API as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>To participate in Adopta.Agency you do not have to be able to code--you just have to be passionate about change in government, tech literate, and not be afraid of learning. There is a learning curve around working with spreadsheets, know the difference between CSV and JSON, and have some base Github awareness, but nothing that should scare you away.</p>
<p>Everything begins with you forking the Adopta Blueprint, staying in tune via the Adopta.Agency blog, and if you get lost submit a Github issue to engage with us around the project.</p>
<p>Thanks for being the change.</p>
