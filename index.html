title: Adopta Agency
---

<p>Adopta.Agency is a movement to encourage average citizens to adopt government agencies, and the open data that they produce. Many government agencies have been hard at work opening up their data, but they just don't have the resources to do everything, and they need our help.</p>
<p>Adopta.Agency is not a technology, is an open blueprint, that allows anyone to target a topic, area of government, or specific datasets, and move it forward one step by producing JSON, and two steps forward by launching an open API.</p>
<p>If you are passionate about being the change you want to see in federal, please join us:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Identify Data</strong> - Come up with ideas for Adopta projects, targeting specific data and topics for improvement.</li>
  <li><strong>Improve Data</strong> - Acquire, clean up, organize, convert, and publish the data as simple CSV and JSON files.</li>
  <li><strong>Share Data</strong> - Publish the data to Github as publicly available JSON and CSV files, and if you can, an API as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>To participate in Adopta.Agency you do not have to be able to code--you just have to be passionate about making change in government, be tech curious, and not afraid to learn new things. There is a learning curve, in that you need to know how to work with spreadsheets, know the difference between CSV and JSON, and have some Github awareness--nothing that should scare you away.</p>
<p>Everything begins with you <a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/adopta-blueprint">forking the Adopta Blueprint</a>, staying in tune via the <a href="http://adopta.agency/blog/">Adopta.Agency blog</a>, and if you get lost along the way, <a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/adopta-website/issues/new">submit a Github issue to engage with us</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks for being the change.</p>
